<b>Table of contents:  </b>

<b>PART 1: </b> Simulate datasets (w/ varying correlation) and generate stunting incidence for Figure 1

<b>PART 2: </b> Simulate datasets (w/ varying correlation) and generate stunting reversal for Figure 1

<b>PART 3: </b> Simulate datasets w/ varying starting LAZ and LAZ shifts and generate stunting indicators for Figure 2a
