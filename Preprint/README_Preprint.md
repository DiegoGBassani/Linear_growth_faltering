## Linear Growth Faltering in LMICs – Simulations and Figures (Pre-Print version)

### Authors: 	Daniel E. Roth, Kelly M. Watson & Diego G. Bassani

These are code and data files related to simulations designed and implemented as a response to ["Early-childhood linear growth faltering in low- and middle-income countries"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06418-5) by Benjamin-Chung and HBGDki collaborators (Nature 2023; 621, 550–557), as presented in a preprint manuscript entitled [“Whole-population perspective is needed for analyses and actions to address linear growth faltering in low- and middle-income countries”](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.24.24309409).  

- This is the STATA do file that runs the simulations and generates the estimates that are plotted in the figures:

>
-	These are the individual data input files called by the R code that generates the figures:
